## Matthew Ramsden

An experienced iOS engineer who has picked up Rust along the way to expand his contributions to the Bitcoin ecosystem. His primary focus is maintaining the bdk-ffi Rust bindings, contributing features, and ensuring the library's robustness, along with leading the development of the [BDKSwiftExampleWallet](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/BDKSwiftExampleWallet) which is an example iOS wallet built on BDK.

He also created the app [Monday](https://github.com/reez/Monday), a Lightning wallet for iOS leveraging LDK Node (which uses BDK for on-chain transactions), and [BitcoinUI](https://github.com/reez/BitcoinUI), a native iOS implementation of the Bitcoin UI Kit from the Bitcoin Design Community. He is also the creator of an app called [Block Screen](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/block-screen/id1533333210) for iPhone and Watch, and co-organizes NashBitDevs.

## ValuedMammal

ValuedMammal is a Rust developer and node operator whose work includes research in the areas of mempool and p2p. He's interested in bitcoin payment solutions, problems around fee estimation, and innovations in bitcoin Script. In 2021 he managed Tangerine node on the lightning network and was active in the PLEBNET community. He started contributing to BDK out of a belief that modern wallets should be built with modern tools and sought out a team that makes no compromises when it comes to quality and correctness and who share a mission to master the fundamentals while providing convenient abstractions to developers. His unorthodox path into software development came as a byproduct of his own Bitcoin journey and continues to grow more fulfilling each day. As a result, his natural environment is in a terminal managing a server or database, and of course writing code. ValuedMammal studied Biological Science at university, and outside of bitcoin he's a writer and educator who likes music, travel, and foreign languages.
